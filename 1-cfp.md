## Submission Guidelines

We welcome two types of papers: regular workshop papers and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the Softconf website set up for this workshop ([https://softconf.com/ijcnlp2023/WorkshopNLPMC2023/](https://softconf.com/ijcnlp2023/WorkshopNLPMC2023/)). In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content.

+ **Regular workshop papers**: Authors should submit a **long paper** of up to **8 pages**, with unlimited pages for references (references only; appendix should be included in the main text and counted towards the page limit), or a **short paper** of up to **4 pages**, with unlimited pages for references. Both long and short papers must follow the ACL 2023 two-column format, using [the supplied official style files](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/style_and_formatting/). Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review. Accepted papers will be presented as posters or spotlight talks. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings.

+ **Cross-submissions**: In addition to previously unpublished work, we also solicit papers on relevant topics that have appeared in other venues (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NLP, ML, or Medical Informatics venues, among others). Accepted cross-submissions will be presented at the workshop, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the NLPMC audience. Submission length is determined by the original venue. Interested authors should submit their papers in PDF format through the [NLPMC Softconf website](https://softconf.com/ijcnlp2023/WorkshopNLPMC2023/), with a note on the original venue. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format and selection will be solely determined by the organising committee.

In addition, we welcome papers on relevant topics that are under review or to be submitted to other venues (including the IJCNLP-AACL 2023 main conference). These papers must follow the regular workshop paper format and will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Papers in this category will be reviewed by workshop reviewers.
